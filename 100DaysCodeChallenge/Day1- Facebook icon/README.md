# 100DaysCodeChallenge

I decided to use the 100 days coding challange to improve my css skills and to learn how to draw with css.
I have followed the code provided by Nathan:

Learning:
I understand about 20% of what was done, even though Nathan is explaining every step of the way.
I realize I am missing some basic drawing css skills, which seems to be different than the skills i got from following CodeCamp course.
