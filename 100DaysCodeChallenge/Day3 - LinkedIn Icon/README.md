Day 3:
I built the LinkedIn logo, which i plan to use in my portfolio page.
But the coolest part is that I discovered how to scale it, so when i resize the wrapper all the elements get resized automatically!!!
Isn't that amazing? :-D

Now step two is to go and apply my new CSS sizing knowledge to the other two logos which i build in the first two days of the challenge.

Day 3 is over. 97 days to GO.
